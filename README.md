# Telegram Bot ðŸ¤–ðŸš€

A versatile Telegram bot that combines fun and security. This bot posts random programming memes to a channel at regular intervals, while also moderating group content by blocking users from posting links, scam keywords, invitations to other groups, and mobile numbers. Additionally, it generates programming challenges every 2 hours and posts the answers 2 hours later, using a cron job to schedule these messages. Keeps your community safe, entertained, and intellectually stimulated!
